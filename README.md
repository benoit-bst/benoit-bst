## Hello world :pray:

I'm **Beno√Æt Brisset**, French native living in Paris.<br>Daddy of 2 adorables :dancers:.<br>**Writing softwares** :computer:<br>

### :small_blue_diamond: In a few words
Curious and passionate about IT since always, I started to apply this discipline in the world of Telecoms about ten years ago. I was working on high performance applications with low latency.
I coded algorithms for different layers of OSI Model. It allowed me to discover **C++** as well as different optimization techniques (_SIMD, multi-threading, GPU Cuda, cache aligment, and so on_).<br>
More and more interested in programming, I decided to take a new way in order to broaden my vision of computing and put my algorithmic skills for it, the route calculation. It allowed me to get a foothold in the world of Rest APIs via the open source [Navitia](https://github.com/CanalTP/navitia) application and its eco-system. It is an application that I maintaine for 3 years now.<br>

### :small_blue_diamond: Computing philosophy

- I pratice the automation religion. If you can automate a process, do it with a good script
- Open Source is a philosophy to which I fully adhere and support.<br> I daily scan new languages and libraries which practice this openness for backend applications
- Following my journey, I naturally turned to learning Rust which is the logical continuation of C++ for me.<br> I love the security arguments behind it and the performance aspect
- I'm a real **Vim/Tmux** zealot. I fell in love for these tools. From now on, I can't do without it anymore :speak_no_evil:.<br> I know, it can be time consuming to set up a good enviroment but this is fun and usefull !

### :small_blue_diamond: Additional 

- I am a street rider :rocket:. Do bicycle and skateboard is my best way to practice sports and enjoy the landscape
- Plants lovers. Like to exchange seeds and cutting with neighbours and friends :seedling:
- Keep trying to be vegetarian for the planet :earth_africa:. Not an easy stuff
